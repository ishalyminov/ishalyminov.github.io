I'm Igor, an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa working on agentic tool calling capabilities of [Alexa+](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence). I obtained my PhD from the [Interaction Lab, Heriot-Watt University](https://sites.google.com/site/hwinteractionlab/) (Edinburgh, UK) working under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Lemon](https://sites.google.com/site/olemon/) and [Dr. Arash Eshghi](https://sites.google.com/site/araesh81/) on Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing methods for data-efficient, robust, and practically applicable dialogue systems. [Dr. Ioannis Konstas](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/academics/ioannis-konstas) and [Prof. Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/) were my examiners - internal and external, respectively. If you think my background could be useful for you, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:igor@shalyminov.com).

You can find my CV pdf [here](/Igor_Shalyminov.pdf).

🚅🚌 **I'm also a fan of public transport so much so that I made T-shirt designs with the logos of some transportation systems here in the US.**
I wear one of those myself and you can do too - check out my [merch page on TeePublic](https://www.teepublic.com/user/pure-virtual), they can work as a nice exclusive gift! 🎨🛍️

⏰🚫 **I also built [Cheat](https://github.com/ishalyminov/cheat), a browser extension to help limit time on distracting sites.**
If you find yourself spending too much time on social media or other time-wasting websites, Cheat gives you a simple way to set time limits and stay focused. It's available for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cheat/hdacefdjjccgpfcindjjkjpfhgpoeimk?pli=1), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cheat/jgonbgoopkddmkdkkmhlecijilkifhpi) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cheat/)!
