I'm Igor, an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa working on Conversational LLM Agents like [Alexa+](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence). I obtained my PhD from the [Interaction Lab, Heriot-Watt University](https://sites.google.com/site/hwinteractionlab/) (Edinburgh, UK) working under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Lemon](https://sites.google.com/site/olemon/) and [Dr. Arash Eshghi](https://sites.google.com/site/araesh81/) on Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing methods for data-efficient, robust, and practically applicable dialogue systems. If you think my background could be useful for you, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:igor@shalyminov.com).

You can find my CV pdf [here](/Igor_Shalyminov.pdf).

🚅🚌 **I'm also a fan of public transport and so much so I made T-shirt designs with the logos of some transportation systems here in the US.** I wear one of those myself and you can do too - check out my merch page on TeePublic, they can work as a nice and exclusive gift: [https://www.teepublic.com/user/pure-virtual](https://www.teepublic.com/user/pure-virtual) 🎨🛍️
